# The project name also defines the project directory name under the
# standard path obtained from Bio.BSF.Default.absolute_projects.

# Analysis Input and Output Directories (optional)
#
# Analysis input and output directories can override standard paths
# from Bio.BSF.Configuration. Both, user and variable expansion gets
# applied. If, at that point, the path is still relative, default
# directory paths from Bio.BSF.Default get prepended. These
# options can therefore remain empty in typical cases and the output
# directory will be created in the standard location from the project
# name.

# Debug Level (optional)
#
# A level of extra information can be set via an integer,
# the higher, the more verbose.

# Defaults to 0.

# debug = 0


# Genome Assembly Version (mandatory)
#
# The genome assembly version corresponds to a resource directory
# holding the genome sequence and Bowtie 2 indices, as well as
# reference transcript annotation files. It is also the name of a new
# sub-directory under the analysis output directory and links to UCSC
# Genome Browser Track Hubs.

# ProcessedRunFolder, BSF Project, BSF Sample, BSF PairedReads and BSF
# Reads objects. Additionally, the file type (i.e. 'CASAVA' or
# 'External') can be specified for automatic discovery of objects in
# CASAVA-processed run folders.

sas_file =


# Sample Annotation Prefix (optional)
#
# An optional sample annotation sheet prefix gets prepended to column
# names. It is useful to distinguish e.g. 'Control Sample' objects
# from 'Treatment Sample' objects defined on the same sample
# annotation sheet.

# Sample Comparison File (mandatory)
#
# The comparison file specifies, which samples or groups should be
# compared.

# deviation.
