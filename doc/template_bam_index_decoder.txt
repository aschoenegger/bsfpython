# Configuration file for the Python Bio.BSF.Analysis BamIndexDecoder
# library module.
#
# Configuration sections correspond to Python package names.
#


[Bio.BSF.Analysis]

# (Meaningful) Project Name (mandatory)
#
# In the context of BamIndexDecoder conversion, the project name is set to the
# flow cell identifier, which is a concatenation of the experiment name and
# the flow cell barcode. It is also the name of the sub-directory in the
# central sequence store, the sequences directory.
#
project_name =


# Analysis Input and Output Directories (optional)
#
# Analysis input and output directories can override standard paths
# from Bio.BSF.Configuration. Both, user and variable expansion gets
# applied. If, at that point, the path is still relative, default
# directory paths from Bio.BSF.Default get prepended. These
# options can therefore remain empty in typical cases and the output
# directory will be created in the standard location from the project
# name.
#
# input_directory =
# output_directory =


# Debug Level (optional)
#
# A level of extra information can be set via an integer,
# the higher, the more verbose.
#
# debug = 0


# Library Annotation File (optional)
#
# A library annotation file specifies in comma-separated value format
# information required for de-multiplexing of BAM files created with
# Illumina2bam.
#
# Column names:
#   lane
#   barcode_sequence_1
#   barcode_sequence_2
#   sample_name
#   library_name
#
# Defaults to 'project_name'_libraries.csv, in the working directory,
# if not explicitly specified.
#
# library_file =


# Illumina2bam Java Class Path (optional)
#
# The class path to the Java Archive (JAR) files for the Illumina2bam package.
# Defaults to the value in Bio.BSF.Default.classpath_illumina2bam
#
# classpath_illumina2bam =


[Bio.BSF.DRMS]

# The General Distributed Resource Management System (DRMS)
# configuration section applies to all analyses in this configuration file.
# Specific sections, configuring specific Bio.BSF.Analysis objects,
# as well as Bio.BSF.DRMS objects follow below.

# DRMS Implementation (optional)
#
# The specific implementation of the DRMS to submit jobs into.
# Defaults to the value in Bio.BSF.Default.drms_implementation
# Examples are SGE or Bash.
#
# implementation =


# Memory Limits per Process (optional)
#
# Generally, the minimum free memory requirements have to be met,
# before a process is started by the DRMS.
# Defaults to the value in ...
#  ... Bio.BSF.Default.drms_memory_free_mem
#  ... Bio.BSF.Default.drms_memory_free_swap
#  ... Bio.BSF.Default.drms_memory_free_virtual
#
# memory_free_mem = 2G
# memory_free_swap = 2G
# memory_free_virtual = 2G
#
# The soft and hard memory limits warn and subsequently kill a process,
# respectively.
# Defaults to the value in ...
#  ... Bio.BSF.Default.drms_memory_limit_hard
#  ... Bio.BSF.Default.drms_memory_limit_soft
#
memory_hard = 6G
memory_soft = 6G


# DRMS Queue (optional)
#
# Defaults to the value in Bio.BSF.Default.drms_queue
# queue = longtime.q


# DRMS Parallel Environment (optional)
#
# The parallel environment defines how multi-threaded processes are run.
# Values are depending on the DRMS implementation.
# Defaults to the value in Bio.BSF.Default.drms_parallel_environment
#
# parallel_environment =


# DRMS Threads (optional)
#
# The number of threads defines how many parallel processes can run
# in each parallel environment.
# Defaults to 1
#
# threads = 1
