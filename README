BSF Python Library

Introduction

The Biomedical Sequencing Facility (BSF) [1] is part of the joint genomics core facility of the
Medical University of Vienna [2] and the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine [3] of the
Austrian Academy of Sciences [4]. The BSF is Austriaâ€™s first technology platform dedicated to
next generation sequencing in biomedicine and expected to play a catalyzing role for the
development of genomic medicine in Vienna and Austria.

This Python library and the accompanying scripts are used for day-to-day analysis of
next-generation sequencing (NGS) data sets.

BSF Python General Configuration File

General settings for the BSF Python library are configured via a $HOME/.bsfpython.ini file
in the user's home directory. This file is site-specific and its information allows for automatic
discovery of raw (e.g. Illumina run folders) and pre-processed (e.g. de-multiplexed lanes and samples)
NGS data. A template file (bsf_init_template.txt) can be found in the doc sub-directory. The template,
which documents the configuration options and provides, as far as possible, sensible default settings,
needs copying to $HOME/.bsfpython.ini before editing accordingly.

Analysis

The BSF Analysis is central to the BSF pipeline infrastructure. It encapsulates both, logic and data
for a multi-step analysis procedure. Specific Analysis objects are available, tailored to recurring
tasks.

Analysis Configuration File

BSF Analysis objects are initialised and configured via UNIX-style configuration (*.ini) files.
Templates for these files are again provided in the doc sub-directory, document configuration options and
provide, as far as possible, sensible default settings. Generally, only few configuration
options need filling in. Most importantly, the location of sample annotation sheets and, depending on the
analysis type, sample comparison sheets, need to be specified.

Sample Annotation Sheet

A sample annotation sheet specifies the file system location of NGS reads. For data pre-processed via
Illumina CASAVA, a hierarchy of run folders, projects samples, and paired reads can be automatically
discovered. Additional reads can be linked into the system by specifying the exact file system path.
Sample annotation sheets also provide grouping of samples that is available to the analysis.

    - Type (CASAVA or External)
    - ProcessRunFolder (e.g. )
    - Project
    - Sample
    - Reads1
    - File1
    - Reads2
    - File2
    - Group

Analyses

ChIPSeq

The ChIPSeq analysis aligns each BSF Sample object to the genome sequence via BWA. Regions of interest
are then defined by means of the MACS2 peak caller.

In the context of the ChIPSeq analysis, BSF Paired Reads objects of BSF Sample objects are aligned as a pool.


RNASeq

The RNA-Seq pipeline is based on the Tuxedo suite. NGS reads are aligned with Tophat2 [] an aligner that
implements a splice site model and uses a reference transcriptome as the base. is based on the Bowtie2 [] short read aligner.

In the context of the Tuxedo analysis, BSF Sample objects are aligned and assembled into transcriptomes individually.
According to a group_replicates configuration option, each BSF Paired Reads object of a BSF Sample object can be
processed individually by TopHat and Cufflinks or pooled before alignment. The resulting transcriptome assemblies
for each BSF Sample resulting from each BSF Paired Reads object are then merged via Cuffmerge. Cuffdiff then compares
the merged assemblies on the basis of the BAM alignments produced by Tophat2.
